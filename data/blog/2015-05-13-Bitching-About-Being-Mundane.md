“With great power comes great responsibility”. For family life, it’s kind of “With great responsibility, you better get some fucking great power!” It’s never going to be good enough, so better power up quick. I would say that the most difficult part for me is the idea of all the possibilities that would have been, which are all forfeited for the price of having a family and being in responsible for one. What could have been is just so enticing compared to what is. Chances to win the lottery is close to zilch, but you can’t help to imagine what your life would be like if you did win.

Personally, I think the largest sacrifice is the flexibility I used to have prior to having a family. Probably never going to happen, but it’s satisfying to feel that if I want, I could go and climb Everest the next day. Now, the mind set has to be providing for family, better future for the kids, maintaining a good relationship with the in-laws…etc. Doesn’t it just sound a bit mundane?! Fuck it, and back to work, got checks to pay~
