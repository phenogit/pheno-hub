Using 2♦ in response to 1N to start a relay sequence has intrigued me since I learned about it. Setting aside the effectiveness in actual competition, all the bidding space can correspond to hand patterns in a very compact and elegant manner(which I’ll describe my method later). I definitely think this specific relay sequence is a good one for people trying to learn about relay bidding to dig into, many insights will be gained.

To define what I’m talking about more specifically, I’m talking about using the 2♦ as a response after a 1N opening to let the opener show his exact hand shape below the 3N level. The 1N opening is balanced, where different people give different definitions, but I’ll just call it as any 5332/4432/4333 hand pattern(actually 6m322 hand shape can be fitted into the response). Let’s first explain how to show hand patterns in a relay sequence.

First, the easy question, how many hand shapes are we talking about? 5332 = 12, 4432 = 12, 4333 = 4. So the total is 28, and if you want to include 6m322 into consideration, that would 6 extra more shapes, so 34 if 6 card minors are considered.

As for how many hand shapes can be shown below 3N after a 2♦ response? I used to be confused when I first started out reading other people’s system notes on relays, feeling it takes so much memory and it’s too ad hoc to be of value. The way I’ve learned to look at this by starting backwards to see how hand patterns are described using relay bidding and look for a pattern. So let’s look at a few examples before we form a pattern.

To start with, let’s list out the possible responses when the relay is started(keep in mind we have to stop before 3N):

1N – 2♦;

– ??

2♥/2♠/2N/3♣/3♦/3♥/3♠/3N

To be able to stop before 3N, there are 8 responses to 2♦, and working backwards from 3N, a pattern will emerge(spoiler, Fibonacci will pop out). Looking at the first couple of bids:

3N – as we are at the limit with which we set ourselves, no more further bidding is possible, hence you can call this an end point if you will, in layman terms, you can fit one hand type in this bid.
3♠ – at first sight, it would seem like since it’s a lower bid than 3N, you should be able to fit more hand types(data) into this bid. Alas, this is not the case when you look it over. When you bid 3♠, the only call that the responder can use beneath 3N is actually the 3N bid, and once responder bids 3N, you have zero space to use, so the illusion of 3♠ having more space in a relay response is a facade. Once you consider the space that needed by the responder to further inquiry(supposing that you have more than one hand type placed in 3♠), you find that there’s no space to perform those actions, so in effect 3♠/3N can only be used to store one hand type each.
3♥ – similar to 3♠, when you respond with 3♥, relayer would have to bid 3♠ which your only response left without going beyond 3N is 3N. Therefore, you don’t actually any space to describe extra info.
In short, 3♥/3♠/3N all only have the capability to contain the same amount of information, which I am using to describe one hand pattern. Keep these three bids in mind, I call them the leaf node bids, which for me means, when you respond with one of these three bids, the bid would specify a specific hand pattern.

Moving on:

4. 3♦ – now we get somewhere, the relayer can bid 3♥ to continue with his relay, and the opener can either bid 3♠ or 3N(remember, these two bids are leaf node bids). So 3♦ can store two hand types.

5. 3♣ – similarly, relayer bids 3♦ to ask for more info, and now opener has the three leaf node bids(3♥/3♠/3N) to use, hence three hand types.

6. 2N – relayer bids 3♣ to continue, where the opener has 3♦ as well as the leaf node bids(3♥/3♠/3N) available for use, so that would bring the total to five hand types(two for the 3♦, and three for the leaf node bids).

I certainly hope you(or the future me) get the picture, because continuing to list out the other bids is just too painful and boring for me. But let’s list out the results of how many hand types can be included for each bid:

3♥/3♠/3N – 1 for each bid
3♦ – 2
3♣ – 3
2N – 5
2♠ – 8
2♥ – 13
Like I said, Fibonacci pops out, anyways, the total hand types you can fit is 34, and if you recall the number of balanced hand types excluding 6m322 hands is 28. So life is good, we can fit all hand patterns with room to spare(and if you add the 6m322 hands in, you get a perfect match of 34 hand patterns along with 34 spaces)! So all functions else aside, the perfect match in number really makes it feel like a waste not to use relays for this specific situation.

There are various ways to try and place the hand patterns into the various bids stated above, which I feel the main difficulty is finding something that’s easy enough to memorize. Even though there might be other considerations, such as trying to optimally let the NT opener be dummy(since his hand type would be known), saving space for the hand types that occurs most often, designing the bids so that it would be hardest for opponents to compete/indicate leads…etc. But all in all, I think the easy to memorize aspect outweighs all the other considerations, unless if you are confident that you and your partner can handle the memory load with ease.

My scheme for how to organize the hands is using the spade count as the base for the grouping of hands. Below is the scheme for the responses:

1st Round:

1N – 2♦;

-??

2♥ = 3S(3532/3523, 3442/3433/3424, 3352/3343/3334/3325, 3253/3244/3235)

2♠ = 2S(2533, 2443/2434, 2353/2344/2335)

2N = 4S + 2/3H(4342/4333/4324, 4243/4234)

3♣ = reserved for 6C hands, not used right now

3♦ = 4S + 4H(4432/4423)

3♥/3♠/3N = 5S(5332/5323/5233)

As you can see, almost all cases can be separated into groups of 2’s and 3’s, so using the leaf nodes to store the groups of threes, and using 3♦ to store the groups of twos, things look good. Only exception in this case is for the 3 spades/hearts case, which we can handle as a special case.

This rant has been long enough, so I’m stopping here, hopefully when I look back it still makes sense.
