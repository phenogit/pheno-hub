Such an humbling experience. Am I being too stern, too lenient, inconsistent? I think my main problem is the inconsistency part. But consistency is just fucking impossible! Especially when I view myself being very accommodating in regards to what others want in nature, that does not translate really well to raising kids. Kid’s probably going to end up on the streets begging for food…
