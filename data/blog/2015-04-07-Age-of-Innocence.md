Off the bat, nothing to do with book/movie. All honesty, read the book/saw the movies, don’t really remember any of it. But this phrase is just brilliant, I often think of this phrase, especially when drunk…

Life is a continuum of experiences accumulated through living, so for me, looking back is always seeing an age of innocence. What used to be black/white blurs into grey, and it’s a bit sad that most likely what I feel strongly about now will be kind of obsolete in the eyes of the future me.

Which is kind of sad in the sense that, as you experience life, life gets boring, and you long for the age of innocence, yet, wouldn’t that defeat the purpose of life?
