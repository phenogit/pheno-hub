Can’t seem to be able to bring myself to want anything…

Maybe that’s the Buddhism in me??? Not the Buddha and spirit kind of bullshit, but the philosophy that everything basically means nothing, that there is not a so called “you”, where the “you” is probably determined the moment that this universe is created, and the creation of the universe might not have meaning as well(I added this part, but I think it makes sense.) Life is a fucking mess, where it’s impossible to want to compare your status with others, but at the same time there’s a voice saying don’t do that. Might as well fucking die than trying to make everything mesh well in the grand scheme of things.

Even when not comparing to others, just thinking about meaning of life is actually so depressing. Even more depressing when not thinking about meaning of life. Wheels just turning, and one day it will stop. Fuck it.
