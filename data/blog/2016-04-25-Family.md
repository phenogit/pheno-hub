I’ve always felt I am not fair to the family. When I’m with anyone other than my direct family, I am pretty sure I am quite charming. But when it comes to interaction with the family, namely mom & dad now, it’s always so awkward…

Looking back, I can’t even say for certain why this is the case. There are so many boo-hoo stories about kids being neglected or even abused by parents, I have to say it’s not the case for me. In general, the family’s pretty caring and not the sort to put too much pressure(but I have to say superficially so, as I do feel there’s a lot of expectations held back that sometimes bubbles up). What the fuck I don’t get, is why I just feel fucking irritated by so much of what they say and do, when logically speaking, it’s mostly reasonable actions/words that are coming out of them. But their words are just so aggravating. Definitely feels like there’s a special mental mode that I go into when I am with them that makes me frequently regret the words that I say.

I have some analysis done on why this is, albeit I feel the arguments might be me just trying to justify this situation. Strongest of the reasons is that I resent them for being the main culprit causing Jean’s suicide. Guess it’s kind of legit, but such a low blow. I mean, I’ve always been their favorite, and I’m punishing them for making me their favorite? Kind of saying, they love me so much, so here’s the punishment…

Any case, things actually look good now, so stopping bitching for now. XD
