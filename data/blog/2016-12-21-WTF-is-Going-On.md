I fucking want to just rip the phone apart, all those Line messages from Dad just fucking make me want to reply cuss words. I feel I’m already under a lot of pressure making the decision of starting my own business early next year and I fucking tried to be polite all the way in the messages, and still I fucking piss them off, they just have to come back with a bunch of bullshit.

Am I so ignorant to have thought that we had the agreement of getting a loan? Fucking remember having that agreement, fuck. Now everyone just fucking says that this agreement never happened, which I guess I can live with, but hell raises if I express shock over this. FUCK. I fucking rather just loan from a bank than take this bullshit. So fucking wanted to reply that directly. God damn it.

檢討檢討…fuck, 檢討個屁啦。

I be damned if I ever ask for money from my parents again.
