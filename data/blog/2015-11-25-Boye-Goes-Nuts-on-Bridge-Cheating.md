Boye has taken his gloves off. In the past month or so, he went ahead and openly accused Fischer/Schartz and Fantoni/Nunes of cheating(actually there was a third pair that admitted to cheating, but I don’t know that pair, and seems to be relatively unimportant). Long story kinda short, for the previous mentioned two pairs, very convincing evidence has surfaced.

A lot of regulation/process stuff going on, but all in all, it’s a sad event. Especially the Fantunes case, where they entered the world stage around 2002. They have won a bunch of international championships as well as many prestigious US tournaments(which are arguably even tougher than world championships).

For me, there are some sad emotions going through my mind:

All championships are tainted. Though I’m still really far away from this, but this meant that you work for a world championship, and either you might have won, but got cheated from it, or that someone else should have won, but we were celebrating some cheaters for decades. Totally discouraged to attempt to reach world class.

What is world class? If a bunch of people are cheating their way to the top, how do I trust if someone’s a better player than me? There’s always going to be doubts going forward. Are they actually a better player than me or are they cheating, even if just using subtle methods… Maybe it doesn’t matter right now(since I think I still have a lot of improvements that can be made, so my baseline can grow), but once I peak, how do I judge my own abilities?

Should I continue to study the Fantunes method? Rayar wants to play this system, used to be a great idea, where it’s a system used by the top ranked players, so it must be a viable system, and worth the time to understand all the details. Now I have no idea if the system is in itself okay, or does the efficiency come from cheating. Trying to learn the intricacies of a system that only is superb because of cheating is just going to waste my time on Earth. Even though there’s no known cracks on if there were cheating going on in the bidding for Fantunes, this doubt is just going to make me wonder whenever I’m studying their system.

Will all cheating be able to be detected? Many mentioned on how stupid the current cheaters are, using methods that are highly detectable and also easy to prove cheating. If the current way of how bridge is played, I would vote for the case that, no, not all cheating will be detected, and go as far as saying that, a good majority of cheating will not be provable. Use some sort of private key for encrypting the method of cheating for this round, and you will almost never be able to prove there’s cheating. If we allow for cheating to be verified via statistical analysis, now we are definitely going down a slippery slope…

Damn, depressing just thinking about this.
