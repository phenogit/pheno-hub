I had a good time enjoying “The Village”. In short, I feel as if a slice of history has been preserved that will probably be forgotten in a couple more generations. Pretty sure that stuff like this happens with every culture/generation, but still cool that a story is told for this incident.

Story of “The Village” is set around 1949 when 國民黨 retreated to Taiwan after wars within China didn’t really turn out well for them. So a bunch of people from the military as well as civilians set foot in Taiwan to supposedly await for the time to recuperate and reclaim China. In short, families are torn apart, new families formed in times of chaos, kids growing up in a disturbed time…the typical things that happen in a war, if there’s a thing as that.

While I have not personally lived through this time, my parents and especially my grand parents were definitely in this era of chaos. There were definitely moments in the play where I can relate to on a personal level, where I can see scenes and conversations that certainly feels close and recognizable to me. In a way, the play is a nice slideshow of my parent/grand parent’s generation, getting a better glimpse of how Taiwan was and why it is what it is now.
